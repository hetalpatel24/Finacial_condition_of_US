# A Data Vizulisation Project 3: Analysis of US Financial Condition.

### Team Name:

### Team Members: Pete Hoessel, Hetal Patel ,Ke Zhao

### Project Link:

Our goal for the final project is to analyze the financial position of the U.S. and help the average person make sense of 
some of what they hear in the news regarding savings, income, wealth, and debt:

Much is said in the media about finance: e.g. GDP is steadily rising, the stock market is booming, yet on the other hand,
the U.S. is in trillions upon trillions of dollars in debt?!

Our objective is to help shed some light on just how dire (or not dire) the U.S. financial situation is through visualization.


## Data exploration of:

*U.S. financial condition vs. other countries

*National level data

*Drilled down data of U.S. households (Assets and liabilities composition and median values)


## Tools we will use:

*Manipulation / cleaning of data via Python/Pandas and/or SQL

*Creating a database in MySQL, with each dataset essentially transformed into a MySQL table in the database

*Tableau to create visualizations

*Creating Dashboard.
